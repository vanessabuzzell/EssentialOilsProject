# EssentialOilsProject
WDD 330 Winter Project
1 Design and build one or more web applications to explore and apply the things
you have learned thus far.

2 As this is the primary work you will do over weeks 10-14, you should plan on spending at least 30 hours on these challenges.  Work with the instructor to manage the scope of your ideas.

3 Once you have settled on an idea or two write it up and submit it here. Because these should be more complex challenges, you should spend more time on this than you may have for the first block to produce a more formal proposal.
